# Prompt Engineering Portfolio

This repository showcases practical examples of prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on security, evaluation, and advanced prompting techniques.

## Models Evaluated

The portfolio includes experiments with:

- **Gemini**
- **Anthropic Claude**
- **Meta Llama**
- **Microsoft Copilot integrations**
- **Grok**

Each entry includes:

- **Goal**: What the prompt was designed to test
- **Prompt(s)**: The exact text used
- **Model Output**: Representative response
- **Analysis**: Observed strengths, weaknesses, or vulnerabilities
- **Refinement**: Adjustments made to improve results

## Categories

1. Security & Red‑Teaming (jailbreaks, injections, data elicitation)
2. Advanced Prompting (few‑shot, chain‑of‑thought, role‑playing)
3. Evaluation & Refinement (failure mode analysis, structured outputs)

## How to Use

Browse the `examples/` folder for individual case studies. Each file is self‑contained and can be read independently.
